Problem: Sorting: 3-Way Partition Problem Introduction
The goal in this problem is to implement the randomized quick sort algorithm so that it works fast even on sequences containing many equal elements.

Task. To efficiently process sequences with few unique elements, your goal is to implement a 3-way partition procedure: < x part, = x part, and > x part.
Input Format: a sequence of n integers a0, a1, . . . , an−1.
Constraints. 1≤n≤105;1≤ai ≤10^9 for all0≤i<n.
Output Format. Output this sequence sorted in non-decreasing order.
